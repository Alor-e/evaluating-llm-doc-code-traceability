Default is to split by double newlines (`['\\n\\n']`).\n\n#### Example\n```python\nfrom crawl4ai.chunking_strategy import RegexChunking\n\n# Define patterns for splitting text\npatterns = [r'\\n\\n', r'\\. ']\nchunker = RegexChunking(patterns=patterns)\n\n# Sample text\ntext = \"This is a sample text.

      "The ExtractionStrategy abstract base class implements the documented 'Choose the Right Strategy' section by providing a flexible framework where different extraction methods (CSS, LLM, Cosine) can be implemented through the abstract extract() method while sharing common parallel processing functionality in run().",
      "The code implements the CSS strategy mentioned in the documentation's best practices by using BeautifulSoup selectors to extract structured data according to a predefined schema.",
      "The code implements error handling and retry logic through ThreadPoolExecutor and try-catch blocks, directly aligning with the documentation's 'Handle Errors' section which shows error checking patterns.",
      "The CosineStrategy class implements the documented 'Cosine for content relevance' best practice by using cosine similarity metrics in the filter_documents_embeddings method to evaluate and filter content based on semantic relevance scores.",
      "The AsyncWebCrawler class implements the documented best practices by incorporating caching mechanisms (through async_db_manager), configurable extraction strategies, and error handling with detailed success/failure reporting in its arun() method.",
      "The code implements error handling patterns shown in the documentation through try-catch blocks that return CrawlResult objects with error messages, while also incorporating the documented best practices of caching and strategy selection.",
      "The AsyncCrawlerStrategy abstract class implements the 'Choose the Right Strategy' section of the documentation by defining core methods that each concrete strategy (CSS, LLM, Cosine) must implement for web crawling.",
      "The AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy class implements the documented error handling pattern through its crawl method, which returns an AsyncCrawlResponse containing success/failure information and extracted content exactly as shown in the documentation example.",
      "The CrawlResult class captures the success/error states described in the error handling documentation through its success, error_message, and extracted_content fields that enable the demonstrated error checking pattern.",
      "The CrawlResult.success boolean property directly supports the error handling best practices shown in the documentation by enabling conditional verification of successful extraction operations.",
      "The error_message field in CrawlResult directly enables the error handling best practice shown in the documentation by providing a string description of what went wrong when result.success is False.",
      "The CrawlResult.extracted_content field stores the successfully crawled data as demonstrated in the documentation's error handling code sample where it's parsed as JSON after a successful extraction."
